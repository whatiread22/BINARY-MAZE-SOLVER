This Maze Solver project in C is an excellent way to practice both graph theory and algorithmic problem solving using techniques like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). Here's a detailed breakdown of how you could approach this project:

1. Project Overview

The Maze Solver project aims to create a program that can take a maze as input and find the shortest path (or any valid path) from the starting point to the destination. The maze can be represented as a 2D grid, where each cell is either walkable (open space) or blocked (wall). The user can input the maze configuration, and the program will apply a pathfinding algorithm to find the solution.

2. Maze Representation

The maze will be represented as a 2D grid (matrix), where each cell can be either:

0: Walkable path.

1: Wall or blocked path.


For example, a 5x5 maze might look like this:

0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

The starting point is usually (0, 0), and the destination is (n-1, n-1) (in a grid of size n).

The goal is to find a path from the start to the end, avoiding blocked paths (1s).


3. Approach and Algorithms

To solve the maze, you can use two common graph traversal algorithms: DFS and BFS.

Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS is a recursive algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

The algorithm can be used to explore all possible paths in the maze and stop when the destination is found.


Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS explores all possible paths level by level and guarantees that the first path found to the destination is the shortest.

BFS is implemented using a queue.


BFS is more suitable for finding the shortest path, but DFS can also be used if you're looking for any valid path.

4. Key Components

Hereâ€™s how you can break down the project:

a. Input the Maze

Ask the user to input the size of the maze and the values for each cell (0 or 1).

Example:

Enter the size of the maze (n x n): 5
Enter the maze:
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0


b. Check Valid Moves

Create a function to check whether a cell is a valid move:

int isValidMove(int maze[n][n], int visited[n][n], int x, int y) {
    if (x >= 0 && x < n && y >= 0 && y < n && maze[x][y] == 0 && !visited[x][y]) {
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}


c. Implement BFS/DFS for Traversal

DFS (Recursive Implementation):

int solveMazeDFS(int maze[n][n], int visited[n][n], int x, int y) {
    // If destination is reached
    if (x == n-1 && y == n-1) return 1;

    if (isValidMove(maze, visited, x, y)) {
        // Mark current cell as visited
        visited[x][y] = 1;

        // Move in all four directions: right, down, left, up
        if (solveMazeDFS(maze, visited, x+1, y)) return 1; // Right
        if (solveMazeDFS(maze, visited, x, y+1)) return 1; // Down
        if (solveMazeDFS(maze, visited, x-1, y)) return 1; // Left
        if (solveMazeDFS(maze, visited, x, y-1)) return 1; // Up

        // Backtrack: unmark the cell if no valid path found
        visited[x][y] = 0;
    }
    return 0;
}

BFS (Queue Implementation):

typedef struct {
    int x, y;
} Point;

void solveMazeBFS(int maze[n][n], int visited[n][n]) {
    Queue queue;
    initializeQueue(&queue);

    Point start = {0, 0};
    enqueue(&queue, start);
    visited[0][0] = 1;

    while (!isQueueEmpty(&queue)) {
        Point current = dequeue(&queue);

        if (current.x == n-1 && current.y == n-1) {
            printf("Found a path to the destination.\n");
            return;
        }

        // Check all four possible directions
        Point moves[] = {{0,1}, {1,0}, {0,-1}, {-1,0}}; // right, down, left, up

        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int newX = current.x + moves[i].x;
            int newY = current.y + moves[i].y;

            if (isValidMove(maze, visited, newX, newY)) {
                Point newPoint = {newX, newY};
                enqueue(&queue, newPoint);
                visited[newX][newY] = 1;
            }
        }
    }

    printf("No path found.\n");
}


d. Marking the Path

Once a solution is found, you can either print the path or mark it on the maze. For instance, after finding the path, mark the solution path with a specific character, like *:

void printMazeWithSolution(int maze[n][n], int visited[n][n]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (visited[i][j] == 1) {
                printf("* ");
            } else {
                printf("%d ", maze[i][j]);
            }
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}
